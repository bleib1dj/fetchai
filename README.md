## ü§î What is FetchAI?

**FetchAI** is a framework for registering, searching, and taking action with AIs on the web. 

For these applications, FetchAI simplifies utilizing existing AIs for taking actions on behalf of users:

- **Open-source libraries**: Register your existing AIs using FetchAI's open-source [universal agent gateway](https://python.fetchai.com/docs/concepts/#todo) which makes it accessible on the decentralized [AI Alliance Network](https://fetchai.foundation/).
- **Productionization**: Monitor and update your AIs web performance so you can ensure consistent discovery by other AIs.

### Open-source libraries

- **`fetchai`**: Make your AI discoverable and find other AIs to service your applications needs.

### Productionization:

- **[Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/)**: A developer platform that lets you monitor and optimize your AIs performance interacting with other AIs.
